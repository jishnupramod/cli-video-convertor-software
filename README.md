  2) Run the script as :
      2.1) python3 convertor.py
      2.2) Input the video file: < INPUT >
      2.3) Input the target format: < INPUT >
      2.4) < ENTER >
  3) If a script executed successfully with 'done!' output as final, the video is converted to the desired format. 
  4) Else, if an error occured, check if all python modules are installed.
